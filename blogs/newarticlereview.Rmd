For the first paper of my PhD project, together with Monique Flecken, I reviewed more than 70 experimental papers on the effect of language on the perception of colour. I am very happy that this paper has now been published!

In this paper, I focused on how the choices of experimental approaches in previous experimental work on language-perception interactions affected their experimental findings...

We found a number of experimental contexts in which colour-perception interactions were more or less likely to occur...
